# COVID-19 researchers

### Tell us what you need

If you are involved in COVID-19 research and you want us to do something for you, just tell us what you need. This can go from a simple mechanical task to remove workload from your team to a full project for which you lack expertise (more info).

Don't worry if you're unsure about the feasibility of the task. We'll figure that out for you.

State the task briefly, and with technical jargon if needed. We'll find the right person to understand your message.

We'll respond within hours. We'll try to get simple tasks done within hours.

If you want to attach any files to your query, send an email to crowdfightcovid19@gmail.com instead of (or in addition to) filling this form.
